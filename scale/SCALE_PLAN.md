# Brookfield Comfort — Scale to £1M Plan

**Started:** February 2026
**Target:** £1M annual revenue within 3 years (by end of FY 2028/29)
**Approach:** Momentum-based, cash-flow-protected growth

---

## 1. Where We Are Now (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Trailing 12-month revenue | ~£310k | Feb '25 – Jan '26 |
| Peak month | £62k (May '25) | Birkenstock spring/summer season |
| Trough month | £8k (Jan '26) | Winter low |
| Shopify revenue (12m) | £158k | Birkenstock-led, Google Ads ROAS ~10x |
| Amazon revenue (12m) | £149k | Lunar-led, high margin |
| Shopify gross margin | ~14.7% | Birkenstock margins are thin |
| Amazon gross margin | ~41.5% | Lunar margins are strong |
| Total gross profit (12m) | ~£86k | |
| Monthly orders (avg) | ~600 | Peak: 1,501 (May '25) |

### Brand Breakdown (Last 12 Months)

| Brand | Revenue | Gross Profit | Margin | Channel |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Lunar | £141k | £57k | 40.6% | Primarily Amazon |
| Birkenstock | £136k | £20k | 14.8% | Primarily Shopify |
| Rieker | £14k | £4k | 30.6% | Amazon |
| Other | £20k | £5k | ~25% | Mixed |

### Two Distinct Engines

1. **Shopify + Birkenstock + Google Ads** — Revenue engine. High ROAS (~10x), captures existing brand demand. Thin margins but reliable volume driver.
2. **Amazon + Lunar (St Ives)** — Profit engine. Strong margins (40%+), loyal repeat buyers, lower customer acquisition cost.

## 2. The £1M Path — Revenue Milestones

| Year | Target Revenue | Growth | Monthly Avg | Key Focus |
|------|---------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Year 0 (current) | £310k | baseline | £26k | Stabilise, protect profit |
| Year 1 (FY 26/27) | £500k | +61% | £42k | Scale proven winners, launch retention |
| Year 2 (FY 27/28) | £750k | +50% | £63k | Expand channels, deepen inventory |
| Year 3 (FY 28/29) | £1M+ | +33% | £83k | Full maturity, diversified revenue |

### Revenue must be profitable revenue

Scaling to £1M on Birkenstock alone would need ~£700k Birkenstock revenue at 15% margin = ~£105k GP.
Current mix (Lunar + Birkenstock) at £310k already generates £86k GP.
**Protecting and growing the Lunar/Amazon profit engine is as important as scaling Shopify/Birkenstock volume.**

### Reality Check: Where Does £1M Come From? (Feb 2026)

**Realistic ceiling from current operations (~£500-630k):**

| Source | Current | Realistic Growth Path | Year 2-3 Target |
|--------|--------:|:----------------------|----------------:|
| Birkenstock/Shopify | £136k | Google Ads scaling (ROAS 10x→5x with more volume), spring/summer push | £250-300k |
| Lunar/Amazon | £142k | Ives stock depth, Buy Box protection, new customer acquisition | £200-250k |
| Rieker/Winter/Other | £32k | Winter Rieker (shipping direct to FBA), Birkenstock slippers, seasonal smoothing | £50-80k |

This gets to **~£500-630k** by doing more of what already works. No new risk, just execution.

**The gap from £630k to £1M (~£350-400k) needs something new:**

1. **Expand Rieker range on Amazon** — most natural next move. Already proven at 32% margin. Previously stocked more styles but cut back. Revisit selectively using sales data — don't speculate, bring back styles with evidence. Account and infrastructure already in place.
2. **Deeper Birkenstock range on Shopify** — more models = more long-tail Google search traffic at the same ROAS. Are there Birkenstock styles with demand that we don't stock?
3. **Waldlaufer on Amazon** — similar demographic, worth evaluating. Amazon ranking not as strong as Rieker so lower priority. Look at when cash allows.
4. **Amazon/Shopify crossover** — Lunar barely sells on Shopify (£12.7k at 11.6% margin vs 43% on Amazon). May just not be where those customers shop.

**2026 is a stabilisation year.** No chasing new brands. Go deep on proven winners (Ives, Birkenstock core, Rieker). Turn a profit first. Expand cautiously when traction and cash allow — Rieker range expansion is the lowest-risk next step when ready.

**Ruled out:** TikTok Shop (wrong demographic), Skechers (margins too thin, same problem as Birkenstock).

## 3. Growth Levers (Prioritised)

### Lever 1: Retention & Repeat Purchase (Low cost, high impact)
- Current repeat rate: 6.8%
- Target: 15% within 12 months
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Birkenstock 90-day repurchase email (test plan ready)
  - [ ] Klaviyo brand-segmented lifecycle flows
  - [ ] Post-purchase education sequences
  - [ ] Seasonal drop alerts for previous buyers
  - [ ] Restock notifications by model and size
- **Impact estimate:** Doubling repeat rate from 7% to 14% on ~3,000 Shopify customers = ~210 additional orders = ~£12k additional revenue at minimal cost

### Lever 2: Google Ads Scaling (Proven, controlled)
- Current spend: ~£17k/year, ROAS 10x
- Significant headroom — even at 5x ROAS, ad spend is profitable
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Incrementally increase daily budget, monitor ROAS weekly
  - [ ] Expand to broader Birkenstock terms where stock supports it
  - [ ] Seasonal budget acceleration (Mar–Jul) and pullback (Nov–Feb)
  - [ ] Track via `google_stock_track` table for spend/stock/sales correlation
- **Constraint:** Stock must be available before increasing spend

### Lever 3: Lunar/Amazon Expansion (Profit growth)
- Lunar is the #1 brand by profit with 40%+ margins
- St Ives model has loyal following
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Identify top-performing Lunar styles and increase stock depth
  - [ ] Test broader Lunar range on Amazon
  - [ ] Evaluate Lunar on Shopify (cross-sell opportunity for Birkenstock buyers?)
  - [ ] Protect Amazon margin — don't race to bottom on pricing
- **Impact:** Every £10k of Lunar revenue = ~£4k GP vs £1.5k GP from Birkenstock

### Lever 4: Seasonal Smoothing (Off-season revenue)
- Nov–Feb currently does £8–16k/month vs £30–62k in peak
- Already improving YoY (+96% to +145% growth in off-season months)
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Evaluate winter-focused brands/products (boots, slippers)
  - [ ] Birkenstock indoor/wool models for autumn/winter push
  - [ ] Amazon winter strategy (Lunar already has year-round styles?)
  - [ ] Adjust Google Ads strategy for winter — different keywords, different products

### Lever 5: Operational Efficiency (Protect cash flow)
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] Price optimisation engine already running — keep refining
  - [ ] Stock-aware pricing (don't sell cheap when running low)
  - [ ] Monitor inventory turnover by SKU and channel
  - [ ] Cash flow forecasting aligned with stock purchasing cycle

## 4. Key Constraints & Guardrails

1. **Cash flow comes first** — No growth initiative should strain working capital to breaking point
2. **Profit before revenue** — A £500k business at 25% margin is better than £750k at 10%
3. **Stock before spend** — Never increase ad spend without stock to fulfil
4. **Test before committing** — Every new initiative starts as a small test (e.g. the 90-day email)
5. **Seasonal awareness** — Plan stock and cash around the Birkenstock cycle

## 7. Analysis — Top SKUs by Gross Profit (Last 12 Months)

**Run date:** 2026-02-17
**Source:** `sales` table (excluding returns), `localstock` (warehouse stock), `amzfeed.amzlive` (FBA stock). Check both `localstock` and `amzfeed` for full stock picture — most Lunar sells on Amazon so FBA stock is where the real numbers are.

### Summary by Brand

| Brand | GP (top 25) | Avg Margin | Key Takeaway |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Lunar (St Ives + Blaze) | ~£57k | 39–46% | Profit engine. 9 St Ives colourways + 3 Blaze = dominant |
| Birkenstock | ~£6.4k | 12–28% | Volume driver but thin margins. Bend best performer |
| Rieker | ~£2.8k | 29–35% | Solid margins, small volumes |
| Goor / Hotter | ~£1.4k | 17–39% | Minor contributors |

### Key Insight

Lunar generates ~8x the gross profit per SKU vs Birkenstock at ~3x the margin. The top single Lunar colourway (St Ives White, £21.9k GP) outearns the entire Birkenstock top 25 combined (~£6.4k). Birkenstock drives Shopify traffic and brand credibility; Lunar pays the bills.

**Action:** Protect Lunar stock depth at all costs. Any Lunar stockout is a direct hit to profit.

### Revenue vs Profit: Birkenstock vs Lunar (12 months)

**Run date:** 2026-02-17

| Brand | Revenue | GP | Margin |
|-------|--------:|---:|-------:|
| Birkenstock (all channels) | £136k | £20k | 14.6% |
| Lunar (all channels) | £142k | £57k | 43.4% |

Revenue is near-identical. Lunar generates ~3x the gross profit.

#### Monthly Breakdown

| Month | Birk Rev | Birk GP | Lunar Rev | Lunar GP |
|-------|--------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|
| Feb '25 | £411 | £141 | £2,449 | £1,072 |
| Mar '25 | £11,507 | £3,499 | £12,556 | £5,356 |
| Apr '25 | £12,896 | £3,153 | £17,232 | £7,476 |
| **May '25** | **£33,689** | **£9,032** | **£26,167** | **£11,091** |
| Jun '25 | £26,292 | £4,241 | £21,949 | £9,123 |
| Jul '25 | £16,014 | **-£157** | £17,997 | £7,451 |
| Aug '25 | £10,492 | £117 | £9,190 | £3,104 |
| Sep '25 | £6,346 | £104 | £8,223 | £2,947 |
| Oct '25 | £6,383 | £25 | £9,654 | £3,591 |
| Nov '25 | £4,185 | £27 | £5,758 | £2,177 |
| Dec '25 | £3,280 | £0 | £4,848 | £1,871 |
| Jan '26 | £2,681 | £17 | £3,249 | £1,247 |
| Feb '26 | £2,112 | £0 | £2,555 | £966 |

#### What This Means

- **Birkenstock has one strong GP month (May)** and one decent month (Mar). Jul onwards margins collapse to zero or negative.
- **Lunar is profitable every single month**, even in winter. Consistent £1–3.5k GP/month off-peak, £7–11k in peak.
- Birkenstock's role is **traffic and brand credibility** on Shopify — people search for it, land on the site. But it ties up cash and only delivers margin in a short spring window.
- **The risk is not Birkenstock itself — it's letting Birkenstock distract from Lunar.** Every pound of cash tied up in Birkenstock stock sitting through winter could be Lunar stock at 43% margin.

**Action:** Never let Lunar stock run low to fund Birkenstock. Birkenstock cash commitment should be seasonal and controlled.

### St Ives Repeat Purchase Analysis

**Run date:** 2026-02-17

| Metric | 12 months | 24 months |
|--------|----------:|----------:|
| Total St Ives customers | — | 428 |
| Repeat buyers | 7 | 11 |
| Repeat rate | — | 2.6% |

Extending from 12 to 24 months only added 4 repeat buyers. These customers are not coming back — it's not a timing issue, it's the nature of the purchase. St Ives is a ~£38 Amazon sandal bought by price-driven shoppers, not brand-loyal ones. They need sandals, they find ours, they buy once.

**What this means for strategy:**
- **No Lunar/St Ives repeat purchase email campaign** — the data says it won't work at 2.6%
- **Lunar growth = new customer acquisition, not retention** — win the Amazon listing, win new buyers
- **Protect Lunar by protecting the listing** — reviews, stock depth, pricing, Buy Box position. That's what drives volume.
- **Klaviyo repurchase efforts stay focused on Birkenstock** — higher price point, brand-conscious Shopify buyers, where loyalty has a realistic chance
